## Goal of the Project

Managing personal finances can be overwhelming, especially when tracking multiple categories manually or across scattered tools. The goal of this app is to provide:

- A **simple, user-friendly interface** to log and manage expenses
- Clear **visual insights** (pie and line charts) to understand spending behavior
-  A quick way to **generate reports** and view maximum spending per category
-  A lightweight and local **SQLite** database backend for offline usage

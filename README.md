- ✅ A **simple, user-friendly interface** to log and manage expenses
- 📊 Clear **visual insights** (pie and line charts) to understand spending behavior
- 🧾 A quick way to **generate reports** and view maximum spending per category
- 📁 A lightweight and local **SQLite** database backend for offline usage
